# Introduction-to-CS-in-c
In this repository I added all of the homework exercises that I wrote in my first programming course in the university 

exercise 1:
The basics of c, how to manipulate characterers, how to recive inputs and do all kind of calculation on them, reversing a number.

excercise 2:
The second excercise was all about function, I created a loop that performs tha following: 
determine if a number i odd Or Even
calculate the sum of the number, and classify it by specific criterions
reciving a number and printing a DavidStar in three sizes;
a function that recive a number and return all the Mersenne Numbers that are smaller than the number
and a function that solves Square Equation (including complex numbers)
